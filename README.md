# Segmentation of Radial Nerve in Ultrasound Images Using Convolutional Neural Network
## Abstract
In recent years, deep learning has achieved huge successes in many aspects such as object recognition and semantic analysis. Deep learning gets a great development in medical image as well. Peripheral Nerve Blocks is a type of regional anesthesia which need to find out the location of nerves and inject anesthetic nearby using ultrasound scanning. However, images recognition by medical experts is time-consuming. We trained a deep learning model which can perform segmentation of nerves in real time processing. It can be applied to an anesthesia technique called ‘Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia (UGRA). UGRA has less side-effect compare to general anesthesia. Our training dataset are acquired from two collaborative hospitals, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital (KVGH) and Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital (KMUH). Our frameworks are based on the U-net model. Moreover, we prune our models using the Net-Trim algorithm, which is capable to reduce the parameters from a trained model. A simplified model consumes less prediction time and memory space. Our proposal achieves 0.59 Dice Coefficient and 0.93 accuracy for nerve segmentation.

In the beginning, we tried to segment nerves with a trimmed 5-layer U-net by applying Net-Trim algorithm. However, we found that the prediction results contained more false negative case, which lead to a lower accuracy rate. As we tried 3 layers and 4 layers U-net in the same settings, we observed that with a shallower model (i.e. less layers) could gain higher accuracy rates but a lower dice coefficient score.
The false negative cases had decreased a lot in models with fewer layers. In order to increase accuracy rate without losing dice score, we used ensemble modeling [31] based on these three models. The final prediction results were determined by average voting from the models (shown in Figure 3-5). The ensemble function is defined as:
F=(∑_(i=1)^n▒P_i )/n
where F is the output matrix, n represents the number of models (n=3 for our method). P_i represents the probability map of model i.
